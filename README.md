# kargotakip

I added e-mail authentication and a login screen in a very simple way and the user can view it when the user receives the cargo. 
Since it is still in the beta stage, the e-mails that are currently registered are kept in the database. 
As soon as possible, cargo tracking will be managed from the database when users in different applications make transactions.
